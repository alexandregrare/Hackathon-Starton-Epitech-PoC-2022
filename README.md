# **dTransfer**

## Issue
Today, if you want to send a file to somebody, you have the choice between many websites such as *WeTransfer*, *Swiss Transfer* and more.
The common factor between these previous choices is that all of them are saving your files in a single centralized database.  
What's the problem about that ?  
All this data is centralized in a single place and its entirety depends on a single actor.

## Solution
**dTransfer** lets your send files to who you want.  
In opposition to other file transfering websites, dTransfer does not save your data in its own database, it is in fact encrypted and saved on the IPFS which ensures security, and availability.
